The key intakes in HR department include - identifying the responsibilities of each  job, appointing the right man to the right post  and evolving a salary package that suits the best in the industry,  based on parameters like qualifications, industry, job location.  This is vital to the HR department as it helps the company in reducing the unnecessary cost while retaining the best talent. \n",
